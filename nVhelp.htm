<h3 id="U1">Linked from DISPLAY</h3>
<p>
In addition to selecting values to be displayed,<br>
 CHANNEL submenu selects whether signals displayed are from CH0 (TX) or CH1 (RX).
</p>
<h4 id="U1L1">linked from TRACE</h4>
<p>Up to 4 simultaneous color-coded data can be plotted.<br>
OFF seems obvious, but SINGLE may be a poor word choice...</p>
<h3 id="U132">linked from REFERENCE POSITION</h3>
<p>An entry of 1-8 (0001 to 0008) places the REFERENCE line 1 to 8 grid spaces from the BOTTOM.<br>
An entry of 8 places the reference trace location to the very TOP of the screen.</p>
<h3 id="U133">linked from ELECTRICAL DELAY</h3>
<p>Calibration data can only be modified with electrical delay specified in picoseconds.<br>
For better accuracy, Hugen customized the shortest and most accurate calibrations kits possible. </p>
<h2 id="U2">linked from MARKER</h2>
<p>While displayed markers can in theory be manipulated by hand or stylus,<br>
touch calibration inaccuracy typically frustrates that. Better to use the 2-way control..<br>
<dl compact>
<dt>SELECT MARKER</dt>
<dd>select (by push) any of MARKER 1 - 4<br>
selecting that same marker again toggles it off.<br>
Sliding the control moves the selected marker.<br>
A selected marker may be used to change START, STOP or CENTER of sweeps.<br>
SPAN changes sweeps when 2 markers are active.</dd></dl></p>

<h3 id="U36">link from PAUSE SWEEP</h3>
This button freezes data collection.
<p>
The nanoVNA must remain powered on at all times to work successfully capture data via USB.<br>
<ol compact>
<li> With the data you wish to "save" and port to your remotely located workstation,<br>
 navigate to STIMULUS > PAUSE SWEEP. Data at the top of the screen will freeze, confirming sweep is paused.

<li> Take care to not inadvertently alter the current state...<br>
 either by the toggle switch or touchscreen.<br>
 Remove the NanoVNA from the DUT,<br> observe that the desired data remains on the display,<br>
 transport it to your workstation, hotplug the device into a USB port,<br>
 then tap on the display a couple of times.
<br> This appears to initiate handshaking and establishes its connection with the workstation.

<li> Launch the nanoVNAsharp app and connect.<br>

App display should match that on the nanoVNA.
<li>Use nanoVNAsharp facilities to save the data. 
</ol>
To be clear, data is <em>not</em> otherwise saved within the NanoVNA.<br>
Once PAUSE is cancelled or the nanoVNA is power cycled, data is flushed and replaced.</p>
